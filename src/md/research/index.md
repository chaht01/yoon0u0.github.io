- **How to support decision-making in chatbot prototyping? (2019.01 - now)**
    - Currently, a chatbot has been popular in many areas. Yet, it is hard to decide the design of chatbot for makers. It is important to design the chatbot with rationale and evidence because not only it directly linked to cost, but also related to bad user experience. To support chatbot designers to make user-centric and 'good' chatbot, we want to help their decision-making process before deployment with giving them enough evidence.
- **Reflection + Practice (2018.08 - now, collaborated with [Janet Huang](http://janetyc.github.io))**
    - Online videos provide rich materials for people to learn conceptual knowledge, but novices often fail to transfer acquired knowledge into practice. To support learners to apply high-level concepts to the task at hand, we explore how to design effective scaffolding for encouraging online learners to reflect on video content and apply acquired knowledge in practice. With insights drawn from reflection theories and models, we attempt to integrate reflection and practice into a video learning process to enhance the learning experience and work performance. Furthermore, we explore the design space of reflective prompting on video learning and the subsequent performance in creative tasks. This research will contribute findings to online video learning and creative tasks.
